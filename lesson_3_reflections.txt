1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When sharing work with other people. 
For back-up of my work on cloud, rather than just my hard drive.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because if it is a public repository on Git Hub, I may not want all the changes pulled to my remote repository on my hard drive.
I can also check and make changes when it's appropriate.. I think.
