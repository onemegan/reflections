1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initialitizing a repository means you are including your files in the current folder into a git repository.
It enables you to use git for version control.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an in-between for the working directory, on my hard drive, and the git repository, on which version controls are kept.
I'm actually not that sure why it's valuable. I guess because it gives you more flexibility about committing things separately.
